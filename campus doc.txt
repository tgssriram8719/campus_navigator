Excellent choices! Let me create the complete Campus Wayfinder Flutter project for you. This will include:

✅ QR code scanning for position detection
✅ 2D floor map with path overlay
✅ A* pathfinding algorithm
✅ In-app admin panel for managing rooms/nodes
✅ Tools to create digital floor plans
✅ Ground floor first approach
Let me set up the complete project structure:

Ran command
c:\sri ram > flutter create campus_wayfinder --org com.campuswayfinder --platforms android,ios

flutter : The term 'flutter' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. 
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ flutter create campus_wayfinder --org com.campuswayfinder --platforms ...
+ ~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (flutter:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
 

Ask every time
Exit code 1
I see Flutter isn't in your PATH. Let me check if it's installed and find its location, or I'll create the complete project structure manually with all the code:

Ran background command
c:\sri ram > where.exe flutter 2>$null; if (-not $?) { Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\", "D:\" -Recurse -Name "flutter.bat" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue 2>$null | Select-Object -First 3 }


Ask every time
Exit code 0
While that searches, let me create the complete project structure manually. This way you'll have all the code ready, and you can run flutter create later if needed:

⚡ Key Features Implemented
Feature	Description
A Pathfinding*	Optimal route calculation between any two nodes
QR Code Positioning	Scan QR at entrance to set your location
2D Map with Path Overlay	Animated blue path with direction arrows
Search & Browse	Find rooms by name or keywords
Turn-by-Turn Directions	Step-by-step navigation instructions
In-App Admin Panel	Add/edit/delete nodes without coding
Multi-Floor Support	Floor selector for buildings with multiple floors

🚀 Next Steps to Run the App
1. Install Flutter
If not already installed:

bash
# Download from: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
2. Initialize Flutter Project
bash
cd "c:\sri ram\campus_wayfinder"
flutter create . --org com.campuswayfinder
flutter pub get
3. Run the App
bash
flutter run
4. Create Your Floor Plan
Follow the detailed guide in 
FLOOR_PLAN_GUIDE.md
 to:

Survey your building
Create a digital floor plan image
Map node coordinates
Add to the app via Admin Panel
📝 Sample Data Included
The app comes pre-loaded with sample data for testing:

Location	Type	QR Code
Main Entrance	Entrance	CAMPUS_MAIN_ENTRANCE
Room 101 - Physics Lab	Room	CAMPUS_ROOM_101
Room 102 - Chemistry Lab	Room	CAMPUS_ROOM_102
Room 103 - Computer Lab	Room	CAMPUS_ROOM_103
Principal's Office	Room	CAMPUS_PRINCIPAL
Library	Room	CAMPUS_LIBRARY
+ corridors, staircases, restrooms...		
🎯 How It Works
User scans QR at entrance → App sets current position
        ↓
User searches for destination (e.g., "Library")
        ↓
A* algorithm calculates shortest path
        ↓
Path displayed on 2D map with animated arrows
        ↓
Turn-by-turn directions shown below map
❓ Questions?
Do you want me to:

Explain any specific part of the code in more detail?
Add additional features like WiFi positioning or voice directions?
Help you create the floor plan for your specific campus?
Set up Firebase for cloud data storage?
Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 🚀
